# Instructions

There are comments in the code. 
To convert a gif:
    use convert_gif()
    You'll need to create a folder in ./Sprites/<target_folder>
    In <target_folder> put target.gif (which is your gif)
    *FYI* using a short gif with low framerate or such can cause all images extracted to be the very first image. 
    *FYI* Not specifying a smoothing can cause the sound to be choppy (or break it if smoothing is too high)


To convert a bunch of images:
    use convert_directory()

To convert a single png
    use Generate_Single_Soundwave()
